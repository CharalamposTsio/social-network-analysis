Topic: Social Network Analysis of Climate Change 

This project was undertaken as part of the Social Network Analysis course in my MSc.

The major purpose of this research is to analyse Twitter data (#tweets) in order to evaluate people's attitudes regarding environmental conservation. Especially, the paper examines the popular keyword "climate" using social network analysis (SNA). Gephi was used as the main visualisation/ exploration tool. Overall, the resulting network contains 117,492 entries, 70,979 nodes (users), and 108,824 edges (interactions) related to discussions on climate issues.
